        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The Certification Program in Emergency Medicine (CPEM) is a 12-month competency-based training initiative, crafted to empower physicians working in Emergency Departments with the essential knowledge and clinical expertise required to excel in emergency care. Developed by leading Emergency Medicine experts at Indus Hospital and Health Network, in collaboration with Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School (Boston, USA) this groundbreaking program was inaugurated at IHHN in July 2018. The program is currently guided by the expertise of EM faculty, IHHN and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).
            <br>
            CPEM has been recognized both by the national and international scientific community as a one-of-a-kind course to bridge the gap in EM in LMICs</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Program Milestones</h4>
        <br>
        <p>CPEM is the first of its kind; capacity building certification program for middle tier physicians working in the Emergency Departments.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Four cohorts have successfully graduated from CPEM, with the third cohort including learners from Pakistan and Dhaka Medical College (Bangladesh); involving > 100 physicians across the two countries, serving both public and private sector hospitals, nationally and internationally.</li>
            <li>Graduates are enrolled in EM training programs in Pakistan and abroad, cleared fellowship programs (MRCEM/FCPS) and are enrolled as teaching faculty/ facilitators in CPEM.</li>
            <li>Published scientific literature in well-reputed journals.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Program Details</h4>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Duration: 12 months certificate course</li>
            <li>Mode of Education: Online didactics and simulations, hands-on skills and simulation workshops</li>
            <li>Online classes: One per week (duration: 3-4 hours)</li>
            <li>Onsite workshops: 3-4 times/year (optional for participants outside Pakistan).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Of note: CPEM does not provide credentialing in specific procedures; graduates should follow their institutional protocols regarding supervision and credentialing.</b></p>
        <br>
        <h4>Program Objectives</h4>
        <br>
        <p>By the end of the certification program learners would be able to:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Organize clinical management of critically ill patients presenting to the ED.</li>
            <li>Implement evidence-based Emergency Medicine in their centers.</li>
            <li>Practice life-saving procedures in the ED (within institutional guidelines).</li>
            <li>Define indications, contraindications, and complications of life-saving procedures.</li>
            <li>Interpret clinical research.</li>
            <li>Implement ED patient safety and quality improvement for improved patient outcomes.</li>
            <li>Participate in Journal clubs/ Case reviews/ Morbidity and Mortality meetings to stay up to date on the latest advancements in Emergency Medicine.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Assessment Strategies</h4>
        <br>
        <h6><b>Formative</b></h6>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Bi-annual feedback by supervisors.</li>
            <li>Weekly online simulation feedback.</li>
            <li>Logbook (maintained by candidates).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h6><b>Summative</b></h6>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Mid and end of year – 100 one best MCQ.</li>
        <li>End of year three oral board cases.</li>
       </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Graduation Requirements</h4>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>For successful completion of the certification, learners must attend at least 70% of the sessions and obtain an average score of 70% (mid-term and final examination).</li>
            <li>Learners may receive additional credit points through case presentations/ reviews, and journal club presentations.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Scope of Practice</h4>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Doctors working in EDs’ without formal EM residency training.</li>
        <li>MBBS graduates in pursuit of EM as a career.</li>
        <li>Other specialty fellows working in EDs’ and aiming to improve EM skills.</li>
       </ul>
